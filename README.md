# Algorithmic Trading in Python

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for building and testing algorithmic trading strategies using Python. It provides the necessary tools and code to implement multiple trading models, integrate financial data APIs, and backtest various strategies. This project is designed to help you understand the practical applications of algorithmic trading while gaining hands-on experience with Python.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **Algorithmic Trading Fundamentals**: Learn the basic principles of algorithmic trading, including:
  - What algorithmic trading is and how it differs from traditional manual trading.
  - Key concepts such as high-frequency trading, backtesting, and risk management.

- **Project Configuration**: Set up the necessary environment for building algorithmic trading systems:
  - Install Python 3.10+ and manage dependencies.
  - Clone this repository and install required Python packages.
  - Learn how to interact with financial APIs to fetch real-time and historical market data.

- **Trading Strategies**: The project includes implementations of several key trading strategies, such as:
  - **Building an Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund**:
    - **Theory & Concepts**: Understand the concept of equal-weighting and how it applies to the S&P 500 index.
    - **Implementation**: Fetch the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 and calculate equal weights for each stock.
    - **Output**: Generate a portfolio allocation based on the equal-weighting strategy.
    - **Additional Ideas**: Explore variations like sector-specific weighting or market cap-based adjustments.

  - **Building a Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy**:
    - **Theory & Concepts**: Learn the foundations of momentum investing and how momentum can be quantified.
    - **Implementation**: Pull historical stock data, calculate momentum scores, and allocate weights based on momentum.
    - **Output**: Generate a momentum-based portfolio and backtest its performance.
    - **Additional Ideas**: Experiment with different momentum indicators like price trends or relative strength index (RSI).

  - **Building a Quantitative Value Investing Strategy**:
    - **Theory & Concepts**: Understand the principles of value investing and how to identify undervalued stocks.
    - **Implementation**: Use financial ratios (e.g., P/E, P/B) to screen and rank stocks.
    - **Output**: Build a portfolio based on the value investing strategy and evaluate its performance.
    - **Additional Ideas**: Integrate other factors such as earnings growth or dividend yield for a more refined strategy.

### Tools and Techniques

- **Data Acquisition**: Learn how to fetch real-time and historical financial data from public APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl.
- **Portfolio Management**: Understand how to calculate portfolio weights, risk-adjusted returns, and perform backtests using historical data.
- **Customization**: The project includes suggestions for expanding the strategies with custom conditions or additional features, allowing for further learning and experimentation.
